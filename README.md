I have been reading a lot, I have been using Goodreads to track what books I have read. I thought it would be cool to access my reading data. 
This repository provides data on what books I have read.

## Usage

```
npm install
Go to index.js and replace key and secret with your own credentials
Get your credentials at: http://www.goodreads.com/api/keys
Once you have your credentials run node index.js
Go to http://localhost:3000/books
```
